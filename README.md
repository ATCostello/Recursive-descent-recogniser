# Recursive descent recogniser
A hand-made recursive descent recogniser built in Java which acts as a compiler for a simple "program" (found in the programs folder). 
Recognises and reports any compilation errors in the provided code. 
Abstract classes made by Roger Garside, John Mariani and John Vidler.
Syntax Analyser and error generation created by myself.

## How to use my system
Run compile.bat and execute.bat.
The output of the compilation process is stored in the output.txt file.
