# Recursive descent recogniser
A hand-made recursive descent recogniser built in Java which acts as a compiler for a simple "program" (found in the programs folder). 
Recognises and reports any compilation errors in the provided code.

## How to use my system
Run compile.bat and execute.bat.
The output of the compilation process is stored in the output.txt file.
